Human body **constantly communicates** with us and wants us to take the "right" action in return. Ironically since most of us are not taught what to look for, we will miss most obvious signs that the body is using to get our attention. 

Of the many body communication signals, "visual signals" are designed to get your attention. Face being the most obvious place that we look at, human body uses face to communicate with us. Ancient physicians very brilliantly back tracked those signs and body signals and created scientific protocols to **predict, prevent or treat** diseases. 

Just like a tooth fistula could originate in one location but end in a totally different location (sometime extra orally). Similarly face is the end location which guides us to the source deep inside the body. 

Also Just like you could easily miss a dormant fistulous track next to a tooth, similarly dormant lines, non-painful lesions on face can be easily missed by an untrained eye. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a60eb2c0cce40f3fb8361c2e20e1c748694468d8.jpg)

**Key pointers**

• No signs are random or unconnected on human body. 

• Every crease, pimple, dark spot, line has a story behind it. 

• Most obvious signs suggests Nutritional deficiencies = body merely asking you to take action and eat correctly.

• Every pimple or breakout shows you which organ is affected. 

Ayurveda, Chinese and Japanese practitioners (good ones) are best known for their ability to look at a patients face and pinpoint the exact source of the problem. If you google face-organ chart there is a wide mix of images which give you some idea but many a times these images can conflict and confuse an unguided wisdom seeker. 

The primary reason for this conflict is due to the inherent differences in fundamental principles of each of these sciences. eg 5 elements in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine differ in each science. So you if you simply follow the images on the internet, you would not know which science that image comes from and can actually lead you to a wrong diagnosis and wrong application of integrative protocol. 

The best documentation of facial diagnosis is found in both Ayurveda and Chinese textbooks however **you must understand the fundamentals** of each of these sciences, especially if you intend to use this as an health care practitioner. 

Now without getting overwhelmed by the Face-Organ Charts seen on the internet, 

* Here are some Quick easy spots on face to look out for 

1\. Continuous Dark circles under eyes -- indicates nutritional deficiencies like Folic acid and/or Vitamin B12\. 

2\. Black/brown spots on Nose tip -- Folic acid Deficiency, circulatory issues. 

3\. Pimples -- Blood toxicity and colon toxicity (hormones triggered incorrectly due to toxins) 

4\. Bags under eyes seen 3-4hr after waking up -- Kidney issues 

**How do I begin learning about Facial Diagnosis? **

• Look at the different face-organ charts and get familiar with the concept that Face is a body communicating with you to show you, your deeper hidden truths. 

• Look at yourself in the mirror and see the problem locations 

• Look at your patients, family members, kids, friends

• Do it quietly first until you get better at being consistently predicting correctly. 

• Have Fun reading and predicting. 

• Congratulate yourself when you do diagnose correctly but keep your eyes open for next commonality that you see.

There is more to Facial Diagnosis. **Will share more later. **

**Point to note: ( to all skeptics)**

1\. Just because you have not been taught about Facial Diagnosis in modern science does not mean, ancient science is a hoax science.(eg: Turmeric was laughed at by modern science 20 years ago, now it is being sold as magic health pill all around the word!!) 

2\. Just because you don't understand this ancient science does not mean it is not scientific. 

3\. Just because modern science has not been able to prove some of this wisdom, does not mean it is not true.(eg: Modern Science believed Earth was flat until 500 years ago. Indian Geography was called _Bhugol_, भूगोल in Sanskrit \[meaning Study of Round Earth\] -- 5000+ years ago!!)

I have personally found enough proof inside original Sanskrit and Chinese textbooks about such ancient wisdom to make me a believer. I have also personally seen spots and circles disappear once the source of the problem was resolved.
